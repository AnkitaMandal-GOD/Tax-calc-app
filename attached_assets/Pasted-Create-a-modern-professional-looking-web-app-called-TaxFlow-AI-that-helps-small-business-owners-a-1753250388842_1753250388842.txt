Create a modern, professional-looking web app called "TaxFlow AI" that helps small business owners and freelancers automate their bookkeeping and tax categorization.

💻 Tech Stack:
- HTML + Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive UI
- JavaScript (Vanilla or React, your choice)
- Backend using Node.js or Express.js
- Google Sheets API integration
- OpenAI API integration

🎨 Design Requirements:
- Modern, clean layout with light grey/white background, black text, green/grey accents
- Smooth animations and section transitions
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- UI should be friendly but professional: rounded corners, cards, soft shadows, subtle feedback colors (red/yellow warnings, green confirmations)

📋 Features:
1. **Upload/Import Expenses:**
   - Simple UI form to manually input or upload expenses
   - Alternatively, connect to a Google Sheet that auto-syncs expense data (sheet structure: Date, Vendor, Amount, Description)

2. **AI Expense Categorizer:**
   - Use OpenAI API to automatically suggest a category for each expense (e.g. “Marketing,” “Office Supplies,” “Travel”)
   - Option for user to approve/edit the AI-suggested category
   - Output updates back into Google Sheet with final category column

3. **Smart Tax Write-Off Checker:**
   - Add a button that lets the user scan expenses for potential tax write-offs
   - Uses AI to flag expenses as "Likely Deductible", "Maybe Deductible", or "Not Deductible"
   - Results shown in a summary dashboard and also written to a new column in the Google Sheet

4. **Prompt Chains for AI Backend:**
   - Categorization Prompt:
     “You are a business expense classification assistant. Based on the following description, suggest the most accurate category for tax bookkeeping purposes. Respond with one of the following: Marketing, Office Supplies, Travel, Meals, Software, Education, Other. Description: [description]”
   - Deduction Flag Prompt:
     “Classify this expense based on its deductibility: Fully deductible, Partially deductible, Not deductible. Description: [description]”
   - Summary Insight Prompt:
     “Based on the list of categorized and deductible expenses, generate a one-paragraph summary that helps the business owner understand their top spending categories and biggest deduction areas.”

🔗 Integrations:
- Authenticate with Google Sheets API to read/write user expense data
- Use environment variables for API keys securely (e.g., `.env` for OpenAI and Google credentials)

🚀 Optional Enhancements:
- Export categorized data as CSV
- Add tooltip explanations for each category
- Add a chatbot sidebar for help & tips powered by OpenAI

🧪 Final Deliverable:
The app should be fully functional and visually polished. Prioritize a clean code structure, reusable components, and easy user flow. Ensure you include error handling for failed API calls and user-friendly feedback messages.

This will be used in a freelancer’s portfolio, so make sure the UI and codebase are impressive, practical, and client-ready.
